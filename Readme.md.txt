# Python Assignment - Module 3

This repository contains solutions to two tasks from Module 3 of the Tutedude Python course.

## Task 1: Check if a Number is Even or Odd
This script takes a number as input and checks whether it is even or odd using a conditional statement.

## Task 2: Sum of Numbers from 1 to 50
This script uses a for loop to iterate through numbers from 1 to 50, calculates their total sum, and prints the result.
